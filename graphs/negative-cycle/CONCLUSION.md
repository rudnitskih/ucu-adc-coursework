# Conclusion
Python is a correct solution for a scientific modeling and prototyping with simple syntax, similar to human language. But as an interpreted language it can not compete in speed with any compiled alternative. So for implementation of any complex algorithm, the one should be ready for writing critical parts on C or use matrix operations instead of loops.
Meticulous implementation research allowed to transform Floyd-Warshall, highly inefficient for shortest path search to adequate solution for negative cycle search on highly connected graph. However, Bellman-Ford still perform better on a sparse data.
