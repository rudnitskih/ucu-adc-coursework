This is the introductory part of your report. Here, we suggest that you first mention why it was
important for your group to study algorithms and data structures – e.g. by giving examples of
what you need to do in your everyday practice.
We further suggest that you explain the matter and structure of your coursework – i.e. please
spend some space for explicitly stating your assignment and then explain in which part of your
report the fulfillment of this assignment is presented.
Last, but not least, please describe precisely who did what in your group – what were your roles
and contributions to the overall success of your Coursework Project.
