# Conclusions

In this coursework we compared algorithms for two typical types of tasks - "Sorting" and "Graph processing".

The coursework teaches us the following skills and assumptions:

1. How to measure and compare two algorithms. Difference between theoretical estimation and practical experience; average, worst- and best-case scenarios. 
2. Ways how store graphs, how do operations with them. Learned how to calculate short-path between two vertices and detect negative cycles in graph 
2. Learned new program language (C++).
3. Python is a correct solution for a scientific modeling and prototyping with simple syntax, similar to human language. But as an interpreted language it can not compete in speed with any compiled alternative. So for implementation of any complex algorithm, the one should be ready for writing critical parts on C or use matrix operations instead of loops.
4. Markdown language is a great tool to describe documentation or API, but a bad solution for reports like this with a lot of formulas.
5. Do not start work on a coursework before 1 week to a deadline:)

Thank you for the reading this report and valuable lectures.
